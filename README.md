# Epic and User Stories

## What is an Epic Story?
 
 * An epic is a large user story that can be broken up into smaller stories or user stories.

## What is a User Story?

 * The more specific tasks bases on the needs/requests of customers or end users. 
 * An informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the custemor or **End User**


## Use Cases

* Use Cases illustrate the interaction between a system and one or more actors.
* **Actors** refer to who or what is using the system. This could be a person or another system.
* It consists of the Use Case (action), Actors (who/user), Goal (what is expected), Precondition (the steps that need to be completed prio) and Summary (what actually happens)
* A Use Case can also have relations to other Use Cases.


### Epic Stories and Use Cases:
	  
* Use Cases and Epic Stories are **NOT** the same.
* Epic Stories and Use Cases are very similar. When modelling a Use Case we have a main flow and alternate flow.

### User Stories and Use Cases:

* The difference for Use Cases when it comes to User Stories is that we have a separate story for each flow.
* Each Use Case will describe the system/user interaction in smaller stages.


## How do Epic and User Stories Fit in Agile and Scrum?

When it comes to the Agile Methodology, Epic Stories are simply too large for an agile team and therefore have to be split into smaller user stories.
With a User Story you are able to monitor and evaluate the tasks that need to be done. The fact that User Stories are smaller stories means that they can be delivered within multiple iterations.

When it comes to SCRUM, Epic stories and be considered useful as it has explicit timeboxed iterations aka Sprints. Most of the time will be organised into 2 - 4 week sprints.
Trello is a good example of how SCRUM works. The user stories are the cards that are generated and moved around the board to show the tasks that need to be done and which ones are completed.
